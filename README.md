:warning: **Important announcement on work for this class** :warning: : I want this class to be ridiculously useful for everybody who takes it. For this reason, some of the class material, such as technical interview practice, is not as relevant to people who have already landed in the job. For this reason there will be TWO TRACKS of work for folks in the class.
- :large_blue_circle: + EVERYBODY does Blue columns - this is foundational career success work
- :large_blue_circle: + ðŸŸ¢ :large_green_circle: IF YOU ARE JOB SEARCHING, you complete work in Blue and Green Columns, including the technical interview questions. These questions are designed to give focused, deliberate practice on key themes of technical interviews. You can SKIP the work in columns the Purpose Columns that are focused on transitioning into a company after you are already employed.
- :large_blue_circle: + ðŸŸ£ IF YOU ARE ALREADY EMPLOYED you complete work in all columns in  blue and purple columns. The green focuses on technical interview questions, which you've already proved your competency on by getting a job. Instead of doing those technical interview questions you will do the work in columns purple that focuses on helping you succeed at the job you already landed and practice being a senior developer mentor. You'll also be leading technical interviews for classmates.
Mark if you are job searching or not in column H. Let me know if you have any questions, if you would prefer to do work in any of the other work streams that you naturally fall into!
